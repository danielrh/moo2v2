// Engine: the pure, deterministic game core.
//
// Layer rules (enforced by scripts/check-boundaries.mjs):
// - No imports from outside src/engine (zero runtime dependencies).
// - No sources of nondeterminism; randomness comes only from the seeded PRNG.

export const ENGINE_VERSION = '0.13.0'; // battlefield enlarged 512x384 -> 768x576: fleets deploy farther apart (the defender line is now relative to the field edge), so closing, flanking and retreating off-field all take meaningfully longer. Combat replays from 0.12.0 diverge at the first battle tick, so older saves load snapshot-first. (0.12.0: engine-maintained default designs per hull class that track research.)
